# pwc-power-bi-virtual-internship
This repository contains Power BI dashboards and analytical insights created during the PwC Virtual Internship (Forage). The project covers real-world data analysis scenarios, including customer churn, diversity reporting, and operational performance, showcasing my skills in data storytelling, DAX, and KPI design.

Businesses often struggle to retain customers due to a lack of visibility into the factors driving churn. Similarly, tracking operational performance and fostering diversity within the organization are key priorities that require data-driven insights. This project aims to solve these challenges by leveraging Power BI to analyze customer behavior, support operations, and workforce diversity. Through interactive dashboards and key performance indicators (KPIs), the project helps stakeholders identify at-risk customers, optimize service delivery, and promote inclusive workplace practices.


**Task 1: Call Centre Trends Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative!**

Total Calls	               Total number of calls received by the call center
Answered Calls	           Number of calls successfully answered
Abandoned Calls	           Number of calls dropped or abandoned before resolution
Average Handle             Time	Average time taken by agents to handle a call
Average Speed to Answer	   Time taken before a customer call is answered

**Task 2: Customer Retention A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.**

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze call center performance and agent efficiency. The dashboard visualizes over 5,000 calls and highlights key operational KPIs such as call handling time, call abandonment rate, and customer satisfaction scores.

Key Features:

- Total and answered calls with abandonment breakdown

- Average handle time and speed to answer

- Agent-wise performance and satisfaction rating
