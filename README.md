# pwc-power-bi-virtual-internship
This repository contains Power BI dashboards and analytical insights created during the PwC Virtual Internship (Forage). The project covers real-world data analysis scenarios, including customer churn, diversity reporting, and operational performance, showcasing my skills in data storytelling, DAX, and KPI design.
Businesses often struggle to retain customers due to a lack of visibility into the factors driving churn. Similarly, tracking operational performance and fostering diversity within the organization are key priorities that require data-driven insights. This project aims to solve these challenges by leveraging Power BI to analyze customer behavior, support operations, and workforce diversity. Through interactive dashboards and key performance indicators (KPIs), the project helps stakeholders identify at-risk customers, optimize service delivery, and promote inclusive workplace practices.
